# ProjectBlockchain

Group Project for DAT650 to model Uncles and uncles rewards. Started with notebook from lectures as init and altered it

Project description:

>The goal of this project is to model uncles and uncles' rewards. In this project, you are expected to:
>
>* Model a blockchain that uses uncles and uncle rewards.
>* Model rewarding mechanism to reward uncle block creators.
>* Model selfish mining (only one attacker) in this blockchain.
>
>
>Try to answer the following questions with your experiments:
>1. -How do uncles improve the fairness of the blockchain? For this, you should compare the outcome of miners with and without uncles.
>2. -What is the impact of uncles on selfish mining? Is selfish mining more profitable with uncles?
>3. -What does it mean in this model for the selfish mining attack to be profitable?
